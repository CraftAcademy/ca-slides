  Out of the box, you get:
  - Views to sign up, sign in, cancel account and edit your "profile" (just email and password for now)
  - Helper methods to check if a user is logged in

  Now let's add a `name` attribute to the `Researcher`.

  Say we want to prevent folks who aren't logged in from accessing the specific dinosaur pages. In the controller:
  ```
  before_action :authenticate_researcher!, only: [:show]
  ```

  We can also allow users to view content on the condition that it is associated with their record.
  ```
  if current_user == @user
    // show something like an edit article page or the like
  else
    // perhaps an error message that they don't have permission
    //  to view that page
  end
  ```

  ## Overwriting the path after sign_up
]
.right-column[
  We may not want to go to the root page after sign-up. We can create all of the devise controllers so we can both see and edit them as needed.
  ```
  rails generate devise:controllers researchers
  ```
  In `routes.rb`, tell your application to head to *your* registrations controller first.
  ```
  devise_for :researchers, controllers: { registrations: 'researchers/registrations' }
  ```
  Open up the registrations_controller:
  ```
  #The path used after sign up.
  def after_sign_up_path_for(resource)
    prehistory_dinosaur_path(id: 2)
  end
  ```
  Now instead of going to the default, root, we will go to the second dinosaur.

  You can overwrite any of the devise controller actions, or add additional information. Keep the `super` to maintain the original Devise functionality, as well as any new functionality you want to add.
